    "RULES:\n",
    "1. **Normalized Relations:** The 'relation_phrase' MUST be a **short, normalized verb phrase** (e.g., 'TARGETED', 'CAUSED', 'LOCATED_AT'). DO NOT use the entire sentence.\n",
    "2. **Directional Semantics:** Ensure the relation describes the Subject's action/state relative to the Object. (e.g., If 'I am the father of my dad', you output nothing. If 'My dad is the father of me', output: 'father_of').\n",
    "3. **Property Modeling:** For temporal/spatial/quantitative relationships:\n",
    "    - Dates (e.g., 'July 1st') or Money (e.g., '$500M') are NOT causal agents.\n",
    "    - If Subject is a **Date** and Object is an **Event**, use: 'MARKED_THE_START_OF' or 'OCCURRED_ON'.\n",
    "    - If Subject is an **Event** and Object is a **Date**, use: 'BEGAN_ON'.\n",
    "4. **Confidence (DAG Filter):** Assign confidence >= 0.9 ONLY if the relationship is explicitly and unambiguously stated. Use a lower score (e.g., 0.5-0.8) for implied or weak (non-causal) relations like 'IS_A' or 'HAS_PROPERTY'.\n",
    "5. **Output Format:** Provide output as a list: [{'subject_id': ID, 'object_id': ID, 'relation_phrase': 'SHORT_PHRASE', 'confidence': float}]\n",
